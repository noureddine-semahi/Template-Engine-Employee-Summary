## Description:
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/"License Badge")
    A Node CLI application that creates a formatted webpage of ID cards displaying info about each member of your Engineering Team. The cards are generated after prompts from user input are answered. They define a clear employee roster with a summary of info. This way a manager can have quick access to employee emails and git-hub profiles for immediate contact.
## Installation:
    This App uses node and npm. It requires node.js to be installed locally.
## Usage:
    This Node CLI app can be used to quickly generate a neatly formatted webpage of ID cards containing employee summaries of the personnel that outfit your software team. The app generates a HTML and CSS file that will be overwritten with each use for convenience.
## Contributing:
    The Coding Boot Camp at UT provided the starter code and templates, I was then able to resolve the missing pieces of the code.
## Test:
    This app went through much unit-testing and you can run further tests, as I did, with the command:$ npm run test
